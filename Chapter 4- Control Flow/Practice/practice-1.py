'''Write a python program with if statement that assigns 20 to the variable 
y and assigns 40 to the variable z if the variable & is greater than 100.''' 

# assign a random number to variable var
var = 120

# if statement checks if var is more than 100
if var > 100:
    # if yes y = 40
    y = 40
    # and z = 20
    z = 20
    # print value of y and z in one line
    print(f'The value of y is {y} and z is {z}.')

# no else statement because question does not specify it
