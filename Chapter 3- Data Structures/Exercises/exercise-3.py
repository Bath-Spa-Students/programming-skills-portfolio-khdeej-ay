'''Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle
or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list
to print a series of statements about these items, such as 
“I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”'''

# create a list of my favourite modes of transport
transport = ["car", "motorbike"]

# use f-strings to print what fav models for each mode of transport
print(f"I would like to own an Audi {transport[0]}.")    #car at index 0
print(f"I would like to own a Honda {transport[1]}.")    #bike at index 1
print(f"I would like to own a Subaru {transport[0]}.")   #car at index 0
print(f"I would like to own a Tesla {transport[0]}.")    #car at index 0
